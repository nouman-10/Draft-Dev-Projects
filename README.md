# How to create a Time Picker in React
## Introduction
    We all have seen those websites that ask for a date and make us confused as to what format we should put the date in or individual text boxes for date, month, and year. Date and Time pickers are a nifty solution to this problem by providing a simple user interface component that makes it easy and intuitive for users to select dates and times using a pop-up or drop-down calendar. 

    There are numerous advantages to using date-time pickers over simple text inputs, such as:
Dates can be validated by restricting them such as two weeks from today.
Only legal dates will be allowed i.e, no dates in future can be allowed
No confusion related to date formats
Validation when selecting date ranges i.e, the “to” date can’t be before the “from” date when selecting “from-to” date fields
Easy selecting of date by just using the mouse as opposed to typing in the date separately.
And many more

    There are multiple uses for such date-time pickers which make them a perfect choice for using in any web/mobile app that deals with date in forms. Some of those uses are as follows:
Meetings can be scheduled by selecting a specific time on the time picker. You can set the duration of the meeting by selecting the ending time
Pick a specific time for an appointment. For instance, a barber shop can have an online appointment system where you can select the time using such a time picker
Pick a range of dates to book a hotel room. An example of such a time picker can be seen on AirBnB’s website when you try to book a room and it asks for “from-to” dates.

    Now that you know the importance and use cases of date-time pickers, let’s see what you will learn in this article. This article will start by making you familiar with different types of date-time pickers. Then you will learn how to build a time-picker in React by setting up the project from scratch and will further teach you how to custom-style that time-picker according to your website’s UI. The aim of this article is to make you comfortable with time-pickers so that you know how to use them in your next project right away

## DIfferent types of Time-Pickers
    There are different types of time-pickers in React (or in web development in general). These types are mainly based on the UI layout of the picker. In this section, you’ll be introduced to some of the most common ones that you can use according to your need:

### Drop-down:
    One of the simplest time-pickers are the ones with dropdowns for selecting the hour and minute. It might not be the best UI but it’s certainly better than text boxes. An example is shown here:

### Scrolling: 
    This, as the name suggests, uses scrolling to select the required time. This can be done for dates as well as time as shown in the below demo:

### Clock:
    This is probably the most intuitive time-picker you would see. This resembles a real clock which makes it easier for any user to pick the correct time. It might seem confusing but it starts by asking for the hour and then changes the numbers on the wheels to select minutes. An example is as shown below:

## Implementing the Time-Picker
    Coming to the part that you guys are actually here for, it’s time to build your very own time-picker in React.js. If you do a quick google search for time-pickers in React, you’ll easily find more than a dozen of them and you can pick any of these that you find suitable for your UI. This article will mention one of them, more specifically the one that comes with [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/). MaterialUI is a great library that takes care of most of your styling for your web app. Let’s get into building your first Time-Picker:

### Create app
Before diving into the code, let’s first create our react app that we are going to be building our Time-Picker in:
```
npx create-react-app time-picker
```
This will create our React application with the following files:

### Install libraries
To use the time-picker in MaterialUI, we need to install two other libraries. One is the MaterialUI and the second library is needed to handle dates. Most people use Moment.js for handling dates in their applications because it is pretty straight-forward to use but  you should actually prefer [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/). The syntax would seem quite different from Moment.js but the bundle size of date-fns is actually almost four times (19.5kB) smaller than that of Moment’s (71.9kB) making it much faster for your web application. Let’s install these libraries now (Note: don’t forget to `cd` into the folder so that the libraries are installed for your respective project):
```
cd time-picker
npm install @date-io/date-fns date-fns @mui/material @mui/lab @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

### Create the Time-Picker
Let’s build our time-picker now. There are multiple date-time pickers to choose from the MaterialUI library. Some of these are mentioned below:
Date Desktop - To choose dates with the UI more suitable for Desktop
Date Mobile - Same as above but more suitable for mobile
TIme - Simple picker for time
Date&Time - A picker that has both of these compatibilities built into it
    
    You will see all of these in action so that you are familiar with different types of time-pickers available. Let’s dive into the code first and then the article will explain what’s going on:

![Code for Date-Time Pickers](https://i.imgur.com/xc9b3QA.jpg)
Let’s break this code and see what every piece of code does:
Firstly, we need to do our imports that are necessary from the MaterialUI and React
Next, we export our function component `App`.
Next, we use the hook, `useState()` to initialize our state to a random date.
We need to create a function that handles any changes to the date as well. We named it `handleChange`.
Now comes the JSX part. We create our individual pickers using the different picker modules inside MaterialUI with appropriate props for `label`, `value`, `onChange` and `inputFormat` which indicates the format in which the dates are shown. 
We need to combine these individual modules into a single parent element and we first do that through the `LocalizatonProvider` which indicates that we are using the `date-fns` library for handling the dates.
Finally, we apply a margin so that the time pickers are aligned in the middle of the web page.

Now, onto the moment we have been waiting for, to see our Time-pickers in action. Start the web app using the following command and go to the url `http://localhost:3000/` on your browser (Note: the above code has to be inside the file `src/App.js` after you erase everything that was initially on it):
```
npm start
```
Now, see the output of our code:

As you can see above, all the time pickers have quite different UI and you can choose any of these that seem better for your purpose. 

## Conclusion:
    In this article, you learned how to build various date and time pickers for your projects in React. You started by learning why time-pickers are useful and the various areas where they can be used. Then you looked into different types of time-pickers and the choice mainly depends on your own preference and the UI of the website. Then you created a react app along with installing the required libraries. Finally, you built various date and time pickers using MaterialUI and saw them in action. You are now ready to use time-pickers in your next React project. Congrats!!
